# 02/03/23 Lab Decomposition, Wireframing & HTML

In this lab, I used a basic website, created a simple Wireframe of it, and attempted to build it using HTML.

> Note: As I haven't fully jumped into CSS yet at time of writing, I did not add any to this lab.

The first step I took was to break down an existing website using Dev Tools. 

## MVP

- Found a website that I liked the look of that had interesting design elements
- Created a simple high-level wireframe for the website. Used a tool like Figma, Miro and even draw it yourself. It included the following:
  - Header
  - Navigation
  - Section
  - Footer
- Re-created this Wireframe using HTML and semantic elements. I included the semantic element for `header`, `nav`, `section`, and `footer`.

## Extensions - Later

- Create a second page for your shiny new website
- Use the same Header, Navigation, and Footer from the first page
- Add a sign-up form to that web page that contains the following inputs:
  - Email
  - Profile Picture (File upload that only accepts `.png` file type)
  - Bio Textarea
  - Age (Number)
